## WorldBrain's Webmarks web client

You want to contribute to our front-end development? Say hello via our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/WorldBrain/contact_us)

### Technical Implementation:

First version of the client is based in the [React Starter](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/redux) project. 
Use it as starting point for client development and later will come up with our own way of building front-end app.
